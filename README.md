# Yun Server Software
# Overview
This is the software to be run on the Arduino Yun for Soccer-bots. 
# What it do
Sends invisible light to the field and recieves invisible light from the field to communicate with computer and allow driver to control roboto
# How it do
uhh
# Why it do
Because getting an FRC control system for every soccer bots team and risking potential damage was too expensive. Also probably pretty hard to interface with compared to the Arduino Yun.
